* TODO check if we need the TOC or should get rid

* TODO think if the case studies are simple enough and add more information there

* TODO justify all the quotes from Sherlock Holmes

*  Problem solving
#+begin_notes
As software engineers, we are constantly solving problems. They can be as hard
as a subtle concurrency bug that takes a week to find, to just understanding why
a library is not behaving as you think it should.

This talk just concentrates on the hard problems and a method about how to tackle them.
I'm in no way an expert problem solver, but the reasons why I wanted to give this talk is because in my career I've spent an enormous amount of time solving hard problems, and in retrospect with a more methodic approach would have allowed me to go way faster and not stress as much.

As you will see from the next slides there are lots of Sherlock Holmes, who I think would have been a great software engineer, or at least a great debugging consultant.

* The method

** Describe the problem

#+begin_quote
“Data! Data! Data!” he cried impatiently. “I can’t make bricks without clay.” ~ Sherlock Holmes
#+end_quote

- don't guess!
- gather as much data as possible
- ask lots of questions
  - when did the problem happen first?
  - what did we change?
  - have any of the external dependencies changed?
  - what external factors are affecting the behaviour

** Reproduce

#+begin_quote
‘You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear.’ ~ Sherlock Holmes
#+end_quote

- can you reproduce it locally
- can you reproduce it in a test
- is it a production only issue
- change *ONE THING AT A TIME*
- *bisect* all the things

** Evaluate your solution

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” ~ Arthur Conan Doyle, The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes
#+END_QUOTE

** Are we done yet?

- is the problem really gone?
- are you sure it can't happen again?
- what else can you do to make the system more resilient/transparent?

** Put it all together

#+begin_src dot :file graph.png
digraph flow {
    data [label="Collect Data"]
    theory [label="Create Theory"]
    worked [label="did it work", shape="diamond"]
    done [label="Well done"]
    test [label="Validate theory"]

    data -> theory
    theory -> test
    test -> worked
    worked -> theory [label="No"]
    worked -> done [label="Yes"]

}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:graph.png]]

* Examples

** A slow request

- moved an API from http to HTTPS
- the API got unbearably slow
- no code changed
- what is going on?

#+REVEAL: split

#+begin_src clojure
(declare heavy-transformations)

(defn do-lots-of-smart-stuff [request]
  (let [ts (cf/parse (-> request :json-params :ts))]
    (heavy-transformations (request))))
#+end_src

|--------------------------------------------+---------|
| fn                                         | max time |
|--------------------------------------------+---------|
| :clojure-debugging.speedy/defn_without-fmt | 21.22μs |
| :clojure-debugging.speedy/defn_with-fmt    | 53.34μs |

** A question of space

- kafka connect workers stop working
- no code changed
- no useful logs anywhere
- the process is still running, it just hangs forever

#+REVEAL: split

#+begin_src clojure
(defn store-files!
  [{:keys [file-writing-pool] :as ctx}
   {:keys [batch-id] :as batch}]
  (log/log "Storing files" {:batch-id batch-id})
  (cp/future file-writing-pool
             (println "writing out these files")))

* Conclusions

#+begin_quote
"The answer is inside you, but it's wrong" ~ Quelo
#+end_quote

*WWHD* (What Would Holmes Do)

* Murder or Bug

 #+ATTR_ORG: :width 150
- Both
  - can cause someone's death
  - it's hard to find the culprit


 #+ATTR_ORG: :width 150
- Bug
  - can often reproduce locally

 #+ATTR_ORG: :width 150
- Murder
  - it's often the butler
